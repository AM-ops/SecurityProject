            <p>
                - a randomly generated key for use as the One-Time Pad.<br /><br />
<p>
                <h4>The Algorithm Itself: </h4>
            <p>Our implementation of the Vernam cipher is pracically the same as i is described. We generate a random key to use only once per encryption, add it numerically to the plaintext or file contents as integers (which represent the bytes) and then decrypt it by subtracting that key again.
            The text "mode" works as it should, ading the numerical values of the letters' position in the alphabet with those of the random key. 
            However, due to the restrictions placed upon working with file contents while using Python (being unamble to change the data type from ineger representaions of bytes) 
            we simply add the random key as with the text (the exception being that the file's is generaed differently as described below) instead of using the XOR function some digital implementations make use of.

                <br />

            <h4>The One-Time Pad Random Key Generator: </h4>
            <p>
                Using python's random library, a key the length of whatever input the algorithm recieves is generated by using;<br />
                - the <b>randrange(65,91)</b> function, or all capital letter's ASCII values, for text encryption as a string, and <br />
                - the <b>randrange(0,256)</b> function, or all possible chartacter's ASCII values, for file encryption as an array of integers. <br/>
                That is to say, it is a key that can consist of some/all 255 ASCII characters in numerical form.
                This key is then used in a further calculation on the once encrypted data as follows: <br /><br />
                For text encryption we make use of the following formula:<br />
                <b>EcryptedValue = (textASCII_Value[ i ] + randomKeyASCII_Value[ i ]% 26) + 65</b><br />(65 is the ASCII value of A)<br />
                And with file encryption we made use of the following formula:<br />
                <b>EcryptedValue = fileDataASCII_Value[ i ] + randomKeyASCII_Value[ i ] % 256</b><br /> -(Taken under modulo256 as character ASCII values are limited to this range)
            </p>
