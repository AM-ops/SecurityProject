        <h2>The J&amp;A Homebrew Algorithm</h2>

            <h4> Our "Homebrew" algorithm makes use of: </h4>
            <p>
                - a mathematical calculation to increase the confusion aspect of the cipher text, and <br />
                - a randomly generated key of all possible unicode/ASCII values to further enchane the confusion and diffusion aspects.<br /><br />
            <p>

                <h4>The Mathematics: </h4>
            <p>
                With the use of a python mathematics library, such as the simple "math" module or NumPy, this calculation can be quite complex provided the programmer's mathematical knowledge is sufficient.
                One limitation this algorithm has is that, for files, no multiplication or division can be used as it changes the byte content between a float and an integer which causes it to loose its encoding type.
                Another is that no mathematical functions that returns multiple values can be used - such as a square root function returning both the positive and negative roots. The integer key a user provides is what is used in these calculations.<br /><br />
                As such, for the text encryption we made use of the following formula:<br />
                <b>ecryptedValue = (key x plainTextASCII_Value[ i ]) - key</b><br /><br />
                And with the aforemntioned restrictions on file encryption we made use of the following formula:<br />
                <b>ecryptedValue = (key x byteASCII_Value[ i ]) - key</b><br />
            </p>
            <p>The decryption of this aspect of the algorithm just takes the inverse of these mathematical calculations. <br /><br /></p>

            <h4>The Secondary Random Key: </h4>
            <p>
                Using python's random library, a key the length of whatever input the algorithm recieves is generated by using;<br />
                - the <b>randrange(65,91)</b> function, or all capital letter's ASCII values, for text encryption, and <br />
                - the <b>randrange(0,256)</b> function, or all possible chartacter's ASCII values, for file encryption. <br />
                That is to say, it is a key that can consist of some/all 255 ASCII characters in numerical form.
                This key is then used in a further calculation on the once encrypted data as follows: <br /><br />
                For text encryption we make use of the following formula:<br />
                <b>againEcryptedValue = ecryptedValue[ i ] + randomKeyASCII_Value[ i ]</b><br /><br />
                And with the aforemntioned restrictions on file encryption we made use of the following formula:<br />
                <b>againEcryptedValue = (ecryptedValue[ i ] + randomKeyASCII_Value[ i ]) % 256</b><br /> -(Taken under modulo256 as character ASCII values are limited to this range)
            </p>
            <p>The decryption of this aspect of the algorithm again just takes the inverse of these mathematical calculations. <br /><br /></p>

            <h4>The Diffusion Aspect: </h4>
            <p>
                As the aforementioned random key is needed for decryption, it is actually included in the cipher text or encrypted file in a manner to increase diffusion of the encrypted data.
                As with the mathematical calculations, it depends on how a programmer wishes to diffuse the key. With this implementation, we have added it as the first half of the encrypted data - <i>which is not too secure now that it's been disclosed :p</i><br />
                In the decryption of the encrypted file or cipher text: <br />
                - The first half is read as the key, and<br />
                - The reamining contents as the encrypted file data or cipher text.
